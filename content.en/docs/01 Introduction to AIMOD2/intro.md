# About

AIMOD2 is the result of three years of research into the fields of threat hunting, digital forensics, incident response, military theory, complexity theory, data analytics and decision making theory.

The framework is designed to capture active defence and cyber resiliency efforts in context of uncertainty and complexity.

AIMOD2 is a modular framework that combines elements from other frameworks or models, drawing from multi-disciplinary approaches:

- CAPEO: to define threat hunting mission structures.
- ADACOP: for operational sense making in cyber ops domains.
- CYNEFIN & OODA: for general sense making and decision making.

There are more elements that inform AIMOD2 which will be added to the framework as it develops further.
