Active Defence Adversarial Cyber Operations Framework or ADACOP, is a framework for sense-making and understanding the relationships between the different domains of active defence. ADACOP describes four tactical domains, namely: Design, Discover, Disrupt and Defend.

ADACOP is one of the foundational frameworks for AIMOD2 because it provides a sense-making device that helps active defenders understand the playing field.

ADACOP aims to layout the problem space that integrates passive and active defence approaches. We base ourselves in the Deleuzian concept of **the problematic space as a generative space**[^1].
