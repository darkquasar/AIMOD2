- Missions represent units of time, which are usually measured in sprints within an Agile framework.
- Hunt Missions are iterative in nature, they can be improved upon and executed as many times as needed.
- Hunt Missions are ideally collective efforts, where at least two hunters are participating in the design, development and execution.
- Hunt Missions have a clearly designated “Mission Lead” whose role is to orient and drive the mission objectives. The Mission Lead is accountable for the mission end to end.
- Hunt Missions are virtual structures, that can incorporate resources from other teams which don’t normally focus exclusively on hunting: SOC analysts, DFIR specialists, purple or red teamers, etc.
- Last but not least, hunt missions make up an iterative approach towards innovation: the research performed during a mission development can quickly become a new service line or product offering.
